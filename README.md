## Genome-host association approach for fungal pathogen genes involved in host specialisation

This repository gathers the scripts that I have used to explore the genetic basis of host specialization in the wheat fungal pathogen *Zymoseptoria tritici*. The biorXiv version of the associated paper will be added. The link will be updated upon acceptance of the publication.
