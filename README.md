## Genome-host association approach for fungal pathogen genes involved in host specialisation

This repository gathers the scripts that I have used to explore the genetic basis of host specialization in the wheat fungal pathogen *Zymoseptoria tritici*. The biorXiv version of the associated paper will be added. The link will be updated upon acceptance of the publication. 

## Data preparation

SNP calling and filtering were performed as described in Feurtey et al., 2023 [[WW_PopGen](https://github.com/afeurtey/WW_PopGen?tab=readme-ov-file#data-preparation)].
